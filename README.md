# P2P Online Graphical Grid Extensible Registry System

Better quality memes and less server load by decomposing them into primitives and sharing across distributed file system

- Meme creator makes content using primitives library in web editor.
- All primitives in highest quality available are ether stored on users devices or actively shared in distributed FS
- Lower bandwidth due to less meme templates being loaded and content sharing shifted from centralized servers to separate user nodes.
